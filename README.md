# py_rogue

A very simple almost-roguelike I made as a frosh.  
(It also doubles as a game of life simulator, there's some neat things that can be done with entity interactions)

The next step in this project would have been developing combat and enemies with a strong focus on balance.
The thought that goes into roguelike balance isn't particularly interesting to me, which is why I abandoned dev on this.
However, looking back at this and wondering where I could have gone with it, I think the direction to go would have been 
a sort of world simulator where the focus would be the natural interactions between entities. This would not be practical 
in python, so the moral of the story is that my next personal project will be a C world simulator with primary inspiration 
coming from dwarf fortress. And I'll actually put it on github, because god knows more of my projects need to end up here.
